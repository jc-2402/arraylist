// Question 2 :Lonely Numbers in ArrayList(MEDIUM)You are given an integer arraylist nums.
// A number x islonely when it appears only once,and no adjacent numbers (i.e. x + 1 and x - 1) 
// appear in the arraylist. Return all lonely numbers in nums. You may return the answer in any order.
// Sample Input 1: nums = [10,6,5,8]
// Sample Output 1: [10,8]
// Explanation :- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear
// in nums.- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.
// - 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.
// Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8].Note that [8, 10] may also be returned.
